INFORMATION SHEET

Evaluating the Efficacy of Sub-National Informational Comparisons
Principal Investigator: Adam Roberts

This form describes a research study that is being conducted by Adam Roberts from the University of Rochester's Department of Political Science. The purpose of this study is to understand how voters use information when deciding which candidate or political party to vote for.

If you decide to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete a survey that will take about 15-20 minutes to complete. The surveys will ask questions about the municipality you live in, demographics, and political topics, including your political preferences, party affiliation, and vote choice in the most recent municipal elections.

You will be asked to provide your location to identify which municipality you live in, but we will not save this information. Some of the survey questions may be upsetting or make you feel uncomfortable, but not any more uncomfortable than you might feel reading the news. You may withdraw at any time. This study will not collect any direct identifiers, like your name or government ID number. However, we will collect some indirect identifiers, namely the municipality in which you live, political affiliation, and demographic information. All information we collect will be stored in a secure manner and only the principal investigator will have access to it. There are no other expected risks. There are also no expected benefits.

Your participation in this study is completely voluntary. You are free not to participate or to withdraw at any time, for whatever reason.
