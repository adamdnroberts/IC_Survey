Anderson notes on JMP:

- disconnect between intro and lit review, need to connect dots between information chain and the observing neighbors thing

Other reasons why these interventions wouldn't work (should cite)
- Cesi Cruz has interventions with information 
- John Marshall media stuff, Feraz and Finan

Minimize citing obscure stuff 
- e.g. don't need to cite Shipan and Volden, etc.

Map
- zoom in on municipalities
- select on map when you select from list

Treatments:
- is it the neighbors or is it because of other things (like news availability)
- need to have a version that it is the same party
- does the map just prime proximity?
- could put descriptive stuff at the end?
