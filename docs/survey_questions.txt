STEP 5: Treatment Groups (Preview)
=====================================

Note: All four conditions shown for preview. In the final survey, respondents are randomly assigned to one group.

--- Group 1: Control ---

[Text displayed:]
"Agave cultivation is a major industry in Mexico, and specialized farming techniques can do a lot to help improve plant health. Specifically, farmers can monitor for invasive pests, implement sustainable harvest cycles, and ensure proper soil drainage to protect the heart of the plant. Decisions about the timing and methods of these agricultural practices are largely in the hands of independent field managers. Therefore, plantation owners have some ability to protect their crops, although many weather patterns that affect agave growth are out of the owners' hands."

--- Group 2: Plain Information ---

[Text displayed:]
"Crime is a major issue in Mexico, and municipal police forces can do a lot to help reduce crime. Specifically, municipal forces can support higher-level operations and supply valuable information, respond first to criminal incidents, and patrol the streets and maintain public order. Decisions about funding and structure of municipal police forces are largely in the hands of municipal presidents. Therefore, municipal governments have some ability to control crime, although many factors that lead to crime are out of the government's hands."

"Robberies in [home municipality] [increased/decreased] by [X]% from 2024 to 2025."

--- Group 3: Same-Party Comparison ---

[Plain Information text above, plus:]
"The following graph shows the change in robbery rates from 2024 to 2025 for [home municipality] and a sample of other municipalities in [state] that are governed by [governing party], as recorded by the Secretariado Ejecutivo del Sistema Nacional de Seguridad Publica (SESNSP)."
